+ Shellshock explanation
+ Recursion
+ Structs
+ Malloc

+ String, null character at end of string
+ string => char*
  + string stores pointer to the address of the char array
+ int* a, data at address at a
+ &a, address of a
+ Buffer overflow
+ Data structures
  + Linked list
    + dynamic
    + struct, int, node
    + when pointer to a struct, -> notation to access field in struct instead of . notation
    + no random access compared to array
  + hash table
    + linear probing
    + separate chaining
    + trie
  + stack
  + queue

+ IP, internet protocol
  + address of computer
+ DHCP
  + Dynamic host configuration protocol
+ DNS
  + translate hostnames to ip addresses
+ TCP, increase probability that data is received
  + splits data into packet
  + record number of packets
  + handshake to make sure that correct number of packets received
+ Ports
  + FTP
  + SMTP
  + DNS
  + HTTP
    + hypertext transfer protocol
  + HTTPS
+ Web
+ html
  + hypertext markup language
  + markup language
