2.  Lossless compression is compression where there is no information lost and the original information may be recovered. With lossy compression information can not be recovered completely. Lossy compression produces files with smaller sizes compared to lossess compression.

4.  It rewrites the metadata that pointed to the file, but leaves the disk blocks containing the file’s contents intact. Specifically, the system modifies the filename’s first character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled. Secondly, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The file information is still left and can be read.
5.  You can write over the clusters previously used by the data, this may be done with specialised software.
