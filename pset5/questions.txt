0.  an obsecure term ostensibly referring to a lung disease caused by silica dust, sometims cited as one of the longest words in the English language.
1.  returns resource usage
2.  16
3.  Reduces memory usage and allows for flexiblity
4.  Reads a character from the file
    Does this everytime the loop is run
    Until end of file
    Checks to see whether character is an alphbetical character or an apostrophe (which is not at the start of the word
    Store character in current word storage and increments the index
    Ignores the rest of the characters if it longer than LENGTH, detect end but it not being a alphabetical character and prepares for the next word by setting index = 0
    Ignores word if it has a digit in it, inogres rests of chracters like in the previous statements
    If the whole word has been found
        End the char array with the null character
        Increases the word counter
        Checks the spelling of the word
        Updates timing benchmarks
        Prints word if mispelled
        Prepares for next word by setting index to 0
5.  fscanf requires the preknowledge of the format of the text for it be able to analysed
6.  Making sure we can't modify the string which is passed, just incase
7.  A hashtable with linked lists for the buckets to take care of the collisions was implemented. DBJ2 hashing function was used to generate a hashtable of size 200,000. 
8.  It wasn't slow, it was faster than the staff code
9.  No changes, did research and tried to use to most optimal algorithm from the beginning
10. I believe the number of operations could be reduced, if a perfect has could be generated, then no collisions need be considered. But considering misspelled word can be anything and the domain is infinite.
